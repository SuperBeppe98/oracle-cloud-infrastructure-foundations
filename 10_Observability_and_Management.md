## Observability and Management

- Understand the Internal State of a System from outside

- Pillars of Observability
    - Traces: Used to understand how different services connect together and how the user request flow throught them
    - Logs: Not much usefull in tracking code execution
    - Events: Log immutable timestamped records
    - Metrics: numeric representation of data measured over intervals on time / Trigger alarms or alerts

- Purposes
    - Blackbox-whitebox monitoring
    - Identifying trend
    - Correlation
    - Identify potential bottlenecks
    - Insights to take action
    - Measuring performance of an application

- Services:
    - Monitoring
    - Logging
    - Event services

- Other services:
    - Operation Insights
    - Logging analytics
    - Database managements
    - Application performance monitoring

## Monitoring

- Monitor and understand the state of a systems
- Collect system metrics
- Track errors
- Store metrics
- React to incidents throught alerts

- Metric: measurement related to a resource
- Metric namespace
- Service metrics or custom

## Logging

- Centralized and secure log management for all logs
- Built on open standards
    - Searchable
    - Actionable
    - Transportable
    -Service Connector HUB
- Log Encryption

- Categories
    - Log Groups
    - Service logs
    - Custom logs
    - Audit logs

## Events

- OCI Events Service
    - Real time
    - Fast alerts on state change

- Concepts: structured and schematized messages
    - Resources
    - Events Service throught rules
    - Event Types throught action
